# About me

With nearly 14 years of experience in product management, business, and UX, I turn ideas into digital products people love. My expertise spans strategy, design, and development, giving me a unique ability to align vision with execution.

I thrive on solving complex problems, optimizing processes, and driving results. Beyond product development, I have a deep understanding of marketing, sales, and supportâ€”allowing me to connect the dots across teams.

I'm currently working for [Nimble](https://github.com/nimblehq) as **Principal Product Manager**.
