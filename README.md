# About me

With over 10 years of experience in product management, user experience and business development, I transform ideas into digital products that people want to use.

Combining analytical skills, creative thinking and effective communication, I deliver value to both customers and users. I'm goal-oriented, curious and loves to learn new things.

I'm currently working for [Nimble](https://nimblehq.co/) as Senior Product Manager. In recent experiences, I got the opportunity to improve agile processes and craft product strategy for various PropTech companies.
